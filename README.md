# JSResourcesMid

This is a list of resources that I'm keeping track of that are great for that mid-level understanding of JS. I will be adding books and articles on here as I come across them. I really enjoy reading and books give my eyes a nice break from the screen after a long day. 


You Don't Know JS Yet - Kyle Simpson
Notes: I'm really enjoying this book so far. The care and understanding that Kyle puts into JS is quite nice. 

JavaScript: The Definitive Guide- David Flanagan
Notes: This is a big one, I'm treating it more like a textbook. It's 665 pages of good information. I received this book in late October 2020, and my goal is to have it all read by October 2021. That's a long time, yes - but I also am enjoying other books along the way. (Infamous for reading more than 1 book at a time. Currently have 4 that I'm actively reading)
